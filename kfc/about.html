                <p class="point1">It’s simple! At KFC, fried chicken is the name of the game. It’s all about that
                    crunch<br> accompanied by crispy, juicy chicken; rolled 7 times in 11 select herbs and spices.
                    <br>Experience a burst of flavor with each bite!</p>
                <p class="point1">Whether it be the quality of our chicken, the curated selection of ingredients or our
                    <br>promise of exceptional service, we always endeavor to do our best, with bucket loads <br>of
                    care! That’s exactly why, even after more than 9 decades, KFC enthusiasts from all<br> over the
                    world keep coming back for more!</p>

                <p class="point1">Our story begins with the man, the myth, the legend himself, Colonel Sanders. In 1930,
                    Sanders bought <br>a roadside hotel and café in Corbin, Kentucky where he used to serve hungry
                    travelers with southern<br> style chicken. He then spent years perfecting his now famous blend of 11
                    herbs and spices. Right until<br> his demise in 1980, Colonel Sanders never stopped working for KFC.
                    To this day, people are still vying<br> to get their hands on the elusive recipe that has remained
                    under wraps.

                </p>
                <p class="point1">Today we are present with over 41,000 KFC restaurants in more <br>than 125 countries
                    and territories. And you know what? There’s still<br> a cook in a kitchen in every last one of them,
                    freshly preparing<br> delicious, finger lickin’ good food!
